## üß™ Theoretical Background: Adipic Acid Synthesis

### 1. **Introduction to Adipic Acid**

Adipic acid (hexanedioic acid) is a dicarboxylic acid that plays a significant role in industrial chemistry, particularly in the manufacture of **nylon-6,6**, polyurethanes, and plasticizers. It appears as a white crystalline powder and is soluble in alcohol and slightly soluble in water.

### 2. **Precursors and Reagents**

Adipic acid is typically synthesized through the **oxidation of cyclohexanol and/or cyclohexanone** using **nitric acid (HNO‚ÇÉ)** as an oxidizing agent. These are common intermediate compounds derived from cyclohexane.

* **Cyclohexanol (C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇO):** A secondary alcohol obtained via partial hydrogenation of phenol.
* **Cyclohexanone (C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄO):** A ketone derived from the oxidation of cyclohexanol or from cyclohexane itself.
* **Nitric Acid (HNO‚ÇÉ):** A strong oxidizing acid used to convert the organic precursors into adipic acid by cleaving C‚ÄìC bonds.

### 3. **Reaction Mechanism Overview**

The oxidation involves the breaking of the cyclohexane ring and the insertion of carboxylic acid functional groups at both ends. The overall process can be simplified as:

```
C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇO (or C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄO) + HNO‚ÇÉ ‚Üí HOOC-(CH‚ÇÇ)‚ÇÑ-COOH + By-products (e.g., N‚ÇÇO, CO‚ÇÇ, water)
```

* Cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone serve as the **organic feedstock**.
* Nitric acid provides the oxidative conditions to generate the final dicarboxylic acid.

### 4. **Yield Factors**

The **yield of adipic acid** depends on:

* **Reactant ratios**: Excess nitric acid can lead to side reactions and reduce yield.
* **Purity and concentration** of reactants.
* **Reaction time and temperature** (typically optimized in real setups but not simulated here).
* **Stoichiometric balance**: Ideal molar ratio for maximum yield.

In this simulator, a simplified linear model is assumed where the yield depends on the weighted average of the three inputs, adjusted for ideal proportions.

### 5. **Educational Simulation Purpose**

This simulation aims to provide:

* An **interactive visualization** of chemical mixing.
* An intuitive understanding of how different reactant quantities influence the **yield of adipic acid**.
* A platform to experiment with **theoretical ratios** without needing a lab.

It is ideal for high school and early college chemistry students to conceptualize organic synthesis and stoichiometry.
