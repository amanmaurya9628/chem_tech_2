###üß™ Theory: Adipic Acid Synthesis Simulator

Objective:
To simulate the preparation of Adipic Acid through an oxidation reaction involving Cyclohexanol, Cyclohexanone, and Nitric Acid, and to visualize the estimated yield based on the input quantities.

üåü Introduction:
Adipic acid (HOOC-(CH‚ÇÇ)‚ÇÑ-COOH) is an important dicarboxylic acid used mainly in the production of nylon-6,6, polyurethanes, and plasticizers. In a laboratory or industrial setting, it can be synthesized through the oxidation of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone using nitric acid.

This simulator demonstrates the stoichiometric interaction between the three reactants and estimates the yield of adipic acid produced. The visual interface using beakers and liquid levels helps mimic a real-life laboratory experience.

‚öóÔ∏è Chemical Reaction:
The simplified chemical equation for the oxidation process is:

C6H11OH + C6H10O + HNO3 ‚Üí HOOC-(CH2)4-COOH + Byproducts
Cyclohexanol (C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅOH) is oxidized to cyclohexanone (C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄO) and further oxidized to adipic acid (C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(CO‚ÇÇH)‚ÇÇ).

Nitric acid (HNO‚ÇÉ) acts as the oxidizing agent in this transformation.

Byproducts such as nitrogen oxides may be produced in a real reaction.

üî¨ Principle:
The simulator follows stoichiometric proportions and estimates the yield based on empirical yield efficiency (e.g., 80% theoretical yield). The input values are converted proportionally to the output value to simulate a realistic lab scenario.

üßÆ Calculation Logic (Simulated):
The simulation takes user inputs for:

1.Cyclohexanol (gm)

2.Cyclohexanone (gm)

3.Nitric Acid (mL)

The yield of adipic acid is calculated as:

Yield = min(Cyclohexanol, Cyclohexanone) √ó 0.8
This assumes cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone are the limiting reactants, and an average 80% yield based on empirical lab results.

Note: Nitric acid is assumed to be present in excess in this simulation.
