### Procedure for Adipic Acid Synthesis Simulation

Preparation of Reactants
Begin by selecting and measuring the required quantities of the following reactants:

Cyclohexanol (in grams)

Cyclohexanone (in grams)

Nitric Acid (in milliliters)

Combining Reactants
Carefully mix the measured Cyclohexanol and Cyclohexanone together. Then, slowly add Nitric Acid to this mixture. This simulates the oxidation reaction involved in adipic acid synthesis.

Initiation of Reaction
The mixture is assumed to undergo an oxidation process where Cyclohexanol and Cyclohexanone are converted to Adipic Acid in the presence of Nitric Acid as the oxidizing agent.

Observation of Yield
The simulator estimates the amount of Adipic Acid produced (in milliliters) based on the proportions of the three input chemicals. The theoretical yield is displayed as a result.

Recording Results
The quantities of each reactant used and the corresponding yield are recorded in a table for analysis and comparison across multiple trials.
