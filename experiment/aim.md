preparation of adipic acid
To design an interactive virtual simulator that allows users to input quantities of Cyclohexanol, Cyclohexanone, and Nitric Acid, and estimate the yield of Adipic Acid formed through their chemical reaction. The simulator visually demonstrates the mixing of reactants and calculates the resulting product, helping users understand the relationship between reactant amounts and product yield in a digital, experimental setup.
