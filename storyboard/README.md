Experiment 1: Adipic Acid Yield Estimation Simulator
### 1. Story Outline
The aim of this virtual experiment is to help students understand how different quantities of Cyclohexanol, Cyclohexanone, and Nitric Acid affect the yield of Adipic Acid. This simulation mimics a real-life laboratory experiment where a user virtually mixes three chemicals and observes the product yield. It is designed to be interactive, visual, and educational—providing learners with practical experience in an entirely digital environment.

Through multiple trials, users develop a deeper understanding of reaction conditions, limiting reagents, and the concept of yield optimization. This simulation not only supports students in their chemistry curriculum but also encourages scientific reasoning and inquiry-based learning.

### 2. Story
This experiment places the learner in a virtual chemical lab setup, where they can perform the synthesis of Adipic Acid by adjusting the quantities of Cyclohexanol, Cyclohexanone, and Nitric Acid. The interface shows beakers for each reactant, along with input fields for adding specified amounts.

The user inputs the values and presses the "Mix Liquids" button. The simulator processes the reaction behind the scenes and visually updates the product beaker to show the resulting yield. A yield value in milliliters is displayed, and all trials are recorded in a table for comparison and analysis. Through this process, the user learns how reactant proportions affect the efficiency and outcome of the reaction.

### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description
The simulator page opens with a clean layout showing:

Title and description of the experiment.

Three vertical beakers labeled with chemical names: Cyclohexanol, Cyclohexanone, and Nitric Acid.

Input boxes below each beaker for entering amounts.

A central "Mix Liquids" button.

A result beaker labeled "Adipic Acid Yield" with an animated liquid fill based on yield.

A table below to track and compare previous trials.
The colors and layout are designed to resemble a real lab bench setup.

### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals
Understand the relationship between chemical reactant quantities and the yield of Adipic Acid.

Learn how to mix reactants and analyze the results through virtual trial and error.

Develop logical reasoning about limiting reagents and optimization in chemical reactions.

Record data from each trial to compare results and derive conclusions.

### 2.3 Set Pathway Activities
The user first reads a short description or objective.

Inputs quantities for each chemical via number input fields.

Clicks on the "Mix Liquids" button to simulate the chemical reaction.

Observes the animated result and the numeric yield value.

Reviews the updated results table that logs each trial.

Changes input values to perform additional experiments and better understand the process.

### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions
Users may be challenged with questions like:

"What combination gives the highest yield?"

"Is there an optimal ratio between Cyclohexanol and Cyclohexanone?"

A random variation in efficiency could be introduced to simulate real-world deviations.

Later versions could include temperature or time as variables to add complexity.

### 2.5 Allow Pitfalls
If a user inputs too little or too much of one chemical, the yield will decrease.

The simulator can give warnings like:

“Yield is low – possibly due to imbalance in reactants.”

“No product formed – check input values.”

This helps users learn to balance reactants and think critically about proportions.

### 2.6 Conclusion
At the end of the simulation, the system can display:

Total number of trials.

Highest yield achieved.

Number of incorrect or unbalanced trials.
This provides a sense of accomplishment and insight into how their inputs influenced results. The user will take away a clearer understanding of how chemical reactions depend on quantity balance and experimental control.
